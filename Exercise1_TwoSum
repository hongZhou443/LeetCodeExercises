Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

class solution{
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        
        int[] res = new int[2];
        
        for(res[0] = 0; res[0] < nums.length-1; res[0] ++){
            for(res[1] = res[0] + 1; res[1]<nums.length; res[1] ++){
                if(nums[res[0]] + nums[res[1]] == target){
                    return res;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return res;
        
    }
}

Basic array traversal. Compares the first element with every other element that comes after. Data is saved in res array to save data usage. Could be optimized via if statements ensuring that numbers greater than target are not tested.
